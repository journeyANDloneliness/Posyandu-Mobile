/***** REACT *******/

1. react setState will be updated after next render.
	not immediatelly after set

2. Array.slice second argument "end" is index too not length after first argument

3. react useEffect run after render

4. react useEffect dont forget to add second argument to state to watch
	it's to avoid invinity loop

5. component's name should start with Capital letter
	other wise like "<com />" react will treat it like normal html element
